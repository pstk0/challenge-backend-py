# challenge-backend-py
 Backend Developer Challenge - Darwin Interactive | Pedro Leal

🎯 Objective:
Your challenge is to create a project that exposes an endpoint displaying the currency rate of USD against EUR.

You can fetch the data from the Frankfurter API, an open-source service providing current
and historical foreign exchange rates published by the European Central Bank.

For detailed API documentation, visit Frankfurter API Docs.


📝 Instructions:

● If no specific date is provided, retrieve, store, and return today's exchange rate values;
● If a date range is specified with (start_date/end_date) query parameters, store the entries
and return only the average of the values within that range;
● Only make API requests if the data for the requested date has not been previously stored;
● Return responses in JSON format. Don't bother styling and formatting the page – that is not the
purpose here.


🔧 Key Competencies:

● You are free to implement the solution to this exercise. However, your proficiency in Python and
the Django framework will be key factors in our evaluation;
● If you're not familiar with Django, we recommend this quick tutorial; It should be enough to help
you get started confidently;
● We value creativity, critical thinking, code readability, and well-structured solutions. These
aspects will play a significant role in our assessment of your work.


🆘 Support:

In case you get stuck, feel free to ask for help. Sincerity is always a good trait!


📬 Submission guidelines:

The solution can be submitted as a ZIP archive via email or as a project in a GIT repository.
Please ensure you include instructions on how to set up and run your solution.
→ The challenge must be submitted by the end of the day on Tuesday, 25th of June, to the email
address careers@darwininteractive.com.


💡Bonus points:

Although it's not required, creating a Docker image with your project files could earn you some extra
points. 😉


Good luck!
